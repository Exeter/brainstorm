#Hey ECC!
This repository will be used as a wiki for Exeter Computing Club to brainstorm and plan collaboratively.

##Ideas/plans/stuff
Put your ideas/plans/thoughts for projects/activities/stuff in this file. Feel free to start a new repository!

####Projects
- A better Exeter Connect
- Implement auto-correct and auto-complete; compression of English text as a corollary problem.
- Easily-deployable (out-of-the-box) HMMT-style guts round scoreboard, with a really solid UI.
- __Something that can get Exeter connect data without Exeter connect itself__
- Implement blog recommendations; generate an aggregate stream of news and things you would (statistically) like.
- Set up a server to run AI competitions.
- Go to AI competitions.
- Web based RPG with programming challenges (like hacker.org but cooler!)
- Autonomous quadcopter
- Virtual bitcoin exchange (with API to accomodate trading bots)

####Workshops
- C/C++
- Embedded systems
- Hacking
- OpenGL
- App development for Iphone and Android

##Thoughts
Next year we must recruit and retain more people at Club Night in order to make use of the server. In order to do that, we must start to do actual projects.
