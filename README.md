- [__Something that can get Exeter connect data without Exeter connect itself__](https://github.com/Exeter/connect--)
- Implement blog recommendations; generate an aggregate stream of news and things you would (statistically) like.
- Set up a server to run AI competitions.
- Go to AI competitions. 
- Web based RPG with programming challenges (like hacker.org but cooler!)
- Autonomous quadcopter
- Virtual bitcoin exchange (with API to accomodate trading bots)
- Write 2D games in Lua (http://love2d.org) 
- Possible Google summer of code projects (http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/projects/list/google/gsoc2012)

####Workshops
- C/C++
- Embedded systems
- Hacking
- OpenGL
- App development for Iphone and Android 
- Data visualization (for example, at http://d3js.org) 

##Thoughts
Next year we must recruit and retain more people at Club Night in order to make use of the server. In order to do that, we must start to do actual projects.
